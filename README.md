# Myujimito

## Introduction
It's a Windows only application made entirely in Python that allows to set a maximum volume thresold that you can't exceed. The code is far from being perfect and well optimised, but at least it works (on my machine). The reason I created this application is for a problem that I may be the only one having, when listening to musics I increase too much the volume at the point where it's too loud, and I don't want to have hearing loss issues 


## How it works ?
Just simply put your threshold betwwen 1 and 100, and click on the "Set" button. Now you just need to unfocus the application by simply clicking outside the window, and now the application will run in the background. If your current volume is greater that the threshold, it will lower it automatically. If you want to stop the application, just right click on the systray icon, and hit "Close", you can also do it by clicking the X in the top right-hand corner of the window, or in Settings > Close.

## Features
- The application is translated in 5 different languages (English, Spanish, French, Yunayunopian and Japanese) | Settings > Change language
- You can set the application to launch at your computer's boot up | Settings > Open at boot up
